## Use
- download lockdown.sh
- open a terminal in the containing folder
- launch the script by using :
```bash
$ sudo ./lockdown.sh 0.2 (delay in hour before lockdown begin) 0.5 (time on wich the computer will be locked)
```

#### ⚠️ Be very careful using that script because once you have launched it, it's impossible to stop it until the lockdown is finished ⚠️
